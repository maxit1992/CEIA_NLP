# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains jupyter notebooks that solves the challenges of each class of the NLP subject.

The NLP subject is placed on the 4th bimester of the Artificial Intelligence Specialization dictated by the UBA (Universidad de Buenos Aires).

## Subject summary
The subject's agenda is as follows:

- **Class 1: Introduction to NLP. Documents vectorization.**
- **Class 2: Text processing, NLP llibraries and Rule-Based Bots.**
- **Class 3: Word Embeddings, CBOW - SkipGRAM, sentences representation.**
- **Class 4: Recurrent neural Networks, sequence problems and next word estimation.**
- **Class 5: LSTM networks, sentyment analysis.**
- **Class 6: Seq2Seq models, translators and chat bots.**
- Class 7: Attention cells. Transformers, BERT & ELMo, fine tuning.
- Class 8: End of course, NLP today and in the future, deploy.

*Note: Classes in bold had a challenge related to the topics*

## Challenges summary

- [Class 1: NLP basic functions](Clase1/).
- [Class 2: Building a basic bot](Clase2/).
- [Class 3: Creating embeddings with GENSIM](Clase3/).
- [Class 4: Text prediction](Clase4/).
- [Class 5: Clothes reviews classification with LSTM](Clase5/).
- [Class 6: Question and answers bot](Clase6/).

### Developing

All challenges where built on notebooks using colab by Google. The files where run previously so they already show the outputs, results and conclusions.

To test them on your own, upload the notebooks files (.ipynb) with the complementary data (if it corresponds) to a colab instance and run all the cells. 

### Prerequisites

Every notebook already has the commands to setup automatically the needed packages and environment on colab.
