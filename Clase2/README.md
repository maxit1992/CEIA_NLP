# Building a basic bot

On the second challenge we built a help bot using TF-IDF technique. We used the the first chapter of the JAVA 8 OCA guide certification book:  "OCA-OCP Java SE 8 Programmer Certification Bundle" by Kathy Sierra, Bert Bates y Elisabeth Robson, to train the bot and then tried to solve, with bot help, the multiple choice questions at the end of the chapter. The results are good in general and funny to watch!
