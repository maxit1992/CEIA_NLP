# Question and answers bot

On the sixth and final challenge, we created a questions and answers bot. The model is based on LSTM encoder/decoder architecture and was trained with conversations given by volunteers.  The results are interesting because the model may not give and answer that is related to the question given, but at least the answers are almost always semantically correct and well formulated.
