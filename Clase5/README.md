# Clothes reviews classification with LSTM

On the fifth challenge, we tried to solve a sentiment analysis of clothes reviews model implementing embeddings and LSTM layers. The model was trained with a dataset of reviews given by a clothes e-commerce. On this case we tested different neural networks architectures and different aproaches to solve the problem and compared the reults. In general the results are regular, but we think we could get good results with a bigger dataset.
