# Creating embeddings with GENSIM

On the third challenge, we generate two word embeddings based on the political speeches of former president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Cristina is known for being a good speaker and transcripts of her speeches are widely available on the internet. The objective is to find, from the embeddings, the words most related to specific topics and to graph a constellation that shows the relationships of words in their speeches and how they changed in two different years
